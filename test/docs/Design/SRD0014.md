## Description
  
TOP clause used in a query without an ORDER BY clause.
  
## Summary
  
TOP clause used in a query without an ORDER BY clause. Add order by clause to make selection predictable.
  
### Examples
  
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[SelectTopNoParen]
	
AS
	set nocount on;
	Select top 100 Col1 from dbo.TestTableSSDT;
RETURN 0

-- SML034, SRD0014
```
  
### Remarks
  
This rule checks for usages of TOP in queries without an ORDER BY clause.
It is generally recommended to specify sort criteria when using TOP clause. Otherwise, the
results produced will be plan dependent and may lead to undesired behavior.
