## Description
  
The object was created with invalid options.
  
## Summary
  
The SQL module was created with ANSI_NULLS and/or QUOTED_IDENTIFIER options set to OFF
  
### Remarks
  
The rule checks existing SQL modules which have ANSI_NULLS and/or QUOTED_IDENTIFIER settings
saved with value OFF. Consider reviewing the need for these options settings, and in case
they are not required, you should recreate the SQL module using a session that has both
these options set to ON. Even these settings may not currently relate performance problems,
they may prevent further performance optimizations, such as filtered indexes, indexes on
computed columns or indexed views.
