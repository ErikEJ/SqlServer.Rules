## Description
  
Avoid 'sp_' prefix when naming stored procedures.
  
## Summary
  
Avoid 'sp_' prefix when naming stored procedures.
  
### Remarks
  
This rule checks for creation of stored procedure with names starting with `sp_`.The prefix
`sp_` is reserved for system stored procedure that ship with SQL Server. Whenever SQL Server
encounters a procedure name starting with sp_, it first tries to locate the procedure in the
master database, then it looks for any qualifiers (database, owner) provided, then it tries
dbo as the owner. So you can really save time in locating the stored procedure by avoiding
the `sp_` prefix.
