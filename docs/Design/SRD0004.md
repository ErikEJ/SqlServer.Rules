## Description
  
Columns on both sides of a foreign key should be indexed.
  
## Summary
  
Consider indexing columns on both sides of a foreign key relationship.
  
### Remarks
  
The rule checks for not indexed foreign keys in the current database. Create an index on any
foreign key as the foreign keys are used in joins almost always benefit from having an index.
It is better to create indexes on all foreign keys, despite the possible overhead of
maintaining unneeded indexes than not to have index when needed.
