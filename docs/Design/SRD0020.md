## Description
  
The query has issues with the join clause. It is either missing a backing foreign key or the join is missing one or more columns.
  
## Summary
  
Make sure you have all the columns for the JOIN relationship as conditions in the ON clause
  
### Remarks
  
<list type="bullet">
<item>It is either missing a backing foreign key or the join is missing one or more columns.
The rule checks the T-SQL code for queries having joined tables and missing join a predicate
for one of the tables. </item>
<item>It identifies the joined table sources which do not have any column
referenced neither in the join conditions nor in the WHERE clause. Without a join predicate,
the query result will include the Cartesian product of all rows.</item>
</list>
