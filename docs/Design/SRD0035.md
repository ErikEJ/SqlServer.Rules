## Description
  
Do not use WAITFOR DELAY/TIME statement in stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
  
## Summary
  
Do not use WAITFOR DELAY/TIME statement in stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
  
### Remarks
  
The rule checks for WAITFOR statement with DELAY or TIME being used inside:
<list type="bullet"> 
    <item>stored procedure</item>
    <item>function</item>
    <item>trigger</item>
</list>
The WAITFOR statement blocks the execution until a specified time or time interval is reached.
This is not typically wanted in a OLTP system unless for a very specific reason.
