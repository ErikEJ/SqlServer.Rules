## Description
  
Wrap multiple action statements within a try catch.
  
## Summary
  
Wrap TRY..CATCH around multiple data manipulation statements.
  
### Remarks
  
The rule checks for SELECT INTO,INSERT,DELETE and UPDATE statements which are neither
inside <c>TRY..CATCH</c> block. This check is important, because, by default, SQL Server
will not rollback all the previous changes within a transaction if a particular statement
fails and setting <c>XACT_ABORT</c> is not ON.
