## Summary
  
Use fully qualified object names in SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE and EXECUTE statements. [schema].[name]
  
### Remarks
  
There is a minor performance cost with not using two part names. Each time SQL Server runs
across a one part name it has to look up the associated schema to the object.
