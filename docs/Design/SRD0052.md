## Description
  
Index has exact duplicate or borderline overlapping index.
  
## Summary
  
Index has exact duplicate or overlapping index. Combine indexes to reduce over-head 
  
### Remarks
  
The rule matches exact duplicating or partially duplicating indexes. The exact duplicating
indexes must have the same key columns in the same order, and the same included columns but
in any order. These indexes are sure targets for elimination. The overlapping indexes share
the same leading key columns, but the included columns are ignored. These types of indexes
are probable dead indexes walking.
