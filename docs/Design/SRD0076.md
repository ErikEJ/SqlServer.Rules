## Description
  
Identical expressions on both sides of a comparison operator.
  
## Summary
  
Identical expressions should not be used on both sides of a binary operator.
  
### Remarks
  
Expressions like WHERE col = col or col &lt;&gt; col are almost always bugs.
If comparing a column to itself is intended (e.g., to find non-NULL values),
use IS NOT NULL instead.
