## Description
  
Repeated NOT operators found. Simplify the expression.
  
## Summary
  
Unary prefix operators should not be repeated (NOT NOT).
  
### Examples
  
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[TestRepeatedNot]
    @Active BIT
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;
    IF NOT NOT @Active = 1
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Active';
    END;
END;

-- SRD0073
```
  
### Remarks
  
A double NOT (NOT NOT condition) is confusing and likely a logic error. If the intent is
to negate, use a single NOT. If the intent is no negation, remove both NOTs.
