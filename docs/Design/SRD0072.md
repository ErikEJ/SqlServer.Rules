|----|----|
| Id | SRD0072 |
| Friendly Name | Variable self-assignment |
| Category | Design |

## Description
  
Variable should not be assigned to itself.
  
## Summary
  
Variables should not be self-assigned.
  
### Remarks
  
Assigning a variable to itself (SET @x = @x) is a no-op and likely a copy-paste bug.
This rule detects SET statements where the same variable appears on both sides.
