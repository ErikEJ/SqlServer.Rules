## Description
  
Consider using RECOMPILE query hint instead of the WITH RECOMPILE option.
  
## Summary
  
Consider using <c>RECOMPILE</c> query hint instead of <c>WITH RECOMPILE</c> option 
  
### Examples
  

               good:
                ```sql
                CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.my_proc
                BEGIN
                    SELECT col_A, col_b 
                    FROM some_complicated_set 
                    WHERE some_complicated_filter = 1 
                    OPTION(RECOMPILE)
                ```
            
               bad:
                ```sql
                CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.my_proc
                WITH RECOMPILE
                ```
              
### Remarks
  
The rule checks that stored procedures do not use <c>WITH RECOMPILE</c> procedure option. The
<c>OPTION(RECOMPILE)</c> is the preferred method when a recompile is needed. The <c>WITH RECOMPILE</c>
procedure option instructs the Database Engine does not cache a plan for this procedure and
the procedure is compiled at run time.
