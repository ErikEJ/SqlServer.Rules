## Description
  
Query uses a high number of joins. 
  
## Summary
  
Reduce number of joined relations.
  
### Remarks
  
Queries that use a high number of joins will cause the compiler to time out trying to find
 a good execution plan. Consider re-arranging the tables in the joins from smallest to
 largest table and applying the FORCE ORDER query hint.
