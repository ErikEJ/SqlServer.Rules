## Description
  
Avoid returning results in triggers.
  
## Summary
  
Avoid returning results in triggers.
  
### Remarks
  
This rule scans triggers to ensure they do not send data back to the caller. 
Applications that modify tables or views with triggers do not necessarily expect results to
be returned as part of the modification operation. For this reason it is not recommended to
return results from within triggers.
