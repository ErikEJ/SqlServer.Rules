# TSQLSmellSCA

This project implements a number of SQL Server static code analysis rules, and publishes these as a NuGet package, that you can use with [Microsoft.Build.Sql](https://github.com/microsoft/DacFx/tree/main/src/Microsoft.Build.Sql) and [MsBuild.Sdk.Sqlproj](https://github.com/rr-wfm/MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj).

## Getting Started

See my blog post [here](https://erikej.github.io/dacfx/codeanalysis/sqlserver/2024/04/02/dacfx-codeanalysis.html) for a step-by-step guide on how to use these rules in your SQL projects.
