	Gathering an Event Log 
	For diagnostic purposes we would like you to gather an event log for the issue that you are experiencing in SSDT. In order to gather a log and send it to a member of the team, please follow the steps below.
 
	Open a new command prompt as Administrator.
	Run the following command

	logman create trace -n DacFxDebug -p "Microsoft-SQLServerDataTools" 0x800 -o "%LOCALAPPDATA%\DacFxDebug.etl" -ets
	logman create trace -n SSDTDebug -p "Microsoft-SQLServerDataToolsVS" 0x800 -o "%LOCALAPPDATA%\SSDTDebug.etl" -ets

	Run whatever the target/issue scenario is in SSDT.
	Go back to the command prompt and run the following commands

	logman stop DacFxDebug -ets
	logman stop SSDTDebug -ets

	The resulting ETL files will be located at %LOCALAPPDATA%\SSDTDebug.etl & %LOCALAPPDATA%\DacFxDebug.etl and can be navigated to using Windows Explorer.
